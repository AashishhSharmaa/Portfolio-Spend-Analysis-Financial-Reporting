![main](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5c79130-d017-4033-93e9-c900357db907)

## **1. Introduction**

This project showcases a financial analysis exercise using Excel, focused on forecasting and actual spend tracking for a portfolio of projects. The core of the analysis involves understanding cash flow (CF) and expense (PL) trends across various business lines and project types.

## **2. Objective**

To analyze and visualize the financial performance of a project portfolio by:

1.	Creating a single pivot table showing actual and forecasted cash flow (CF) and expenses (PL) monthly.

2.	Developing a presentation-level dashboard and slide deck with:
o	A full-year forecast graph.
o	Charts by business line and project type.
o	Key insights derived from the data.

3.	Answering two business-critical questions related to budget variance and forecast anomalies.

## **3. Dataset Provided**

A raw dataset containing full-year financial forecasts and actuals across multiple projects. It includes:
‚Ä¢	Cash Flow (CF): Total spend on a project, including resource costs, capital expenditure, and other expenses.
‚Ä¢	Expense (PL): A subset of CF, reflecting the actual operating expenses only.

‚ö†Ô∏è Figures in past months = actuals; figures in future months = forecasts.

## **4. Requirements**

Part 1.	A single pivot table displaying both CF and PL across months and FY totals (in millions (MM)).

Part 2.	A dashboard slide including:
o	FY forecast graph (CF & PL)
o	Charts for breakdown by business line and project type
4.	Key insights from the analysis.

Part 3.	Responses to:
o	Which business line/team had the biggest variance?
o	Any project with unusual forecasting?

**Pivot Table: Monthly Forecast and Actual Spend by Project (CF & PL)**

This pivot table showcases the monthly forecast and actual spend by project, where:
‚Ä¢	November 2024 ‚Äì April 2025 represents actuals
‚Ä¢	May 2025 ‚Äì October 2025 represents forecasts
