## **1. Introduction**

This project showcases a financial analysis exercise using Excel, focused on forecasting and actual spend tracking for a portfolio of projects. The core of the analysis involves understanding cash flow (CF) and expense (PL) trends across various business lines and project types.

## **2. Objective**

To analyze and visualize the financial performance of a project portfolio by:

1.	Creating a single pivot table showing actual and forecasted cash flow (CF) and expenses (PL) monthly.

2.	Developing a presentation-level dashboard and slide deck with:
o	A full-year forecast graph.
o	Charts by business line and project type.
o	Key insights derived from the data.

3.	Answering two business-critical questions related to budget variance and forecast anomalies.

## **3. Dataset Provided**

A raw dataset containing full-year financial forecasts and actuals across multiple projects. It includes:
•	Cash Flow (CF): Total spend on a project, including resource costs, capital expenditure, and other expenses.
•	Expense (PL): A subset of CF, reflecting the actual operating expenses only.
